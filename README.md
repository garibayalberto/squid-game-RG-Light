# Squid Game Red Light Green Light

Note: I created this by following along with a FreeCodeCamp tutorial on YouTube. If you would like to try it yourself here is the link : https://youtu.be/4HSxX-EKJjw

This project uses the following: 

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Three.js library https://threejs.org/
- GSAP library https://greensock.com/

This project is a little buggy but the purpose was to get familiar with the three.js library. This was a nice introduction into the library by using a creative format. Go ahead and try it yourself or check out the freecodecamp tutorial at the like above.
